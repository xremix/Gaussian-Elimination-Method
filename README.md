## Usage
Enter your Matrix space seperated into the textfield, including the result vector.

Your Matrix must have the form:
`Ax=b`
While `A` must be a `n * n` Matrix and `b` the result vector. 
The input must have `n+1` columns and `n` rows.

If you want to calculate a matrix like this:
```
1a + 2b + 3c = 2
1a + 1b + 1c = 2
3a + 3b + 1c = 0
```

Your input into the tool would be:
```
1 2 3 2
1 1 1 2
3 3 1 0
```

The result of the tool then would be:
```
a = 5
b = -6
c = 3
```
