## Usage
Enter your Matrix space seperated into the textfield, including the result vector.

Your Matrix must have the form:
`Ax=B`
While `A` must be a `n * n` Matrix.
The input must have `n+1` columns and `n` rows.

The input for the Matrix
```
x1+2x2+3x3=2
x1+x2+x3 =2
3x1+3x2+x3=0
```

Would be:
```
1 2 3 2
1 1 1 2
3 3 1 0
```
